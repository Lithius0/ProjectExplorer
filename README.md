# ProjectExplorer

This project is an exploration of C# and game creation. I have no promises of what this will turn into.

This project started as a class project to make a clone of a game. I enjoyed the project enough to want to continue it afterward, so I copied the files to this repo. I do not own the rights to any part of the game we cloned so all assets and references to it have been removed. Hopefully, that also prevents this repo from showing up in the search engine of future students of that class trying to copy someone else's work.
